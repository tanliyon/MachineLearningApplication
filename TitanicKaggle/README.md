<h1>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</h1>
<p>Available on kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic</p>
<p>Introductory supervised learning application which requires basic feature engineering and data cleaning. The number of features are quite little, hence the dimension space is relatively small.</p>
<p>Compared the accuracy of various machine learning algorithms like random forest, SGD, perceptron, etc from Scikit-Learn and settled on random forest for the highest accuracy.</p>
